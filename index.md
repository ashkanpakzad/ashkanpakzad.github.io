The Antikythera Mechanism is best described as a 2000 year old ancient greek astronomical computer. Having laid on the sea for the majority of this time its bronze interior has corroded and calcified making it incredibly fragile. X-ray CT was utilised as a non-destructive tool to analyse it, unfortunately it became apparent that the most promising scan of the main fragment was missing raw projections. In this project where projections were missing and reconstructed the CT images to the originally intended quality.
